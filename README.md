Dissertation work on The Development of Advanced Chemometric Methods for the Analysis of Deep UV Resonance Raman Spectra of Proteins

Hello, this repository is to serve as a storage area for my doctoral work. All coding files are matlab files. Any files which I did not write the code for, the authors are listed in the file. I in no way wish to take credit for any of the contributions of others which were used in my research. They have been included because it may be of interest to anyone reviewing my work to see the code. 

Please feel free to ask any questions you may have. Also feel free to take review the code as an example of my work.

Thank you,

Special acknowledgement for Dr. Renee Jiji for taking me on as a student, thank you.
